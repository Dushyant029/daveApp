# Clone 📑

- The website is completely built on `react-native` library of `javascript` and that's why we need `nodejs` and `npm` installed.
- While installing `nodejs` and `npm`, try to install versions which are equal or greater than the versions mentioned in badges above.
- In case you want to help developing it or simply saving it, you can fork the repository just by clicking the button on the top-right corner of this page.
- After the successful installation of `nodejs` and `npm`, clone the repository into your local system using below command:
  - ```python
     git clone https://github.com/Dushyant029/daveApp.git
    ```
  - This will clone the whole repository in your system.
- To download required dependencies to your system, navigate to the directory where the cloned repository resides and execute following command:
  - Run the proj
      - ```
        $ npm install
        $ npm start
